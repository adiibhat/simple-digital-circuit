# üîå Simple Digital Circuit ‚Äì Falstad Simulation

This repository contains a simple digital circuit designed using the **Falstad Circuit Simulator**. The project demonstrates the use of basic electronic components including capacitors, inductors, resistors, and a power source to model a fundamental electrical behavior.

## üß∞ Components Used

- ‚ö° **Power Source** (DC or AC)
- üåÄ **Inductor (L)**
- ‚ö´ **Capacitor (C)**
- üü§ **Resistor (R)**
- üîó **Ground Connection**

These components are connected to demonstrate fundamental circuit principles such as resonance, damping, and time-constant effects.

## üß™ Circuit Simulation

The circuit was designed and exported using the [Falstad Circuit Simulator](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/). It is included as a `.txt` file which you can easily import into the simulator to run or modify.

### üîÑ How to Run the Simulation

1. Visit [Falstad Circuit Simulator](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/)
2. Go to **File > Import From Text...**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `circuit.txt` from this repository
4. Click **OK** to load and simulate the circuit

 ## üõ†Ô∏è Customization Tips

You can expand this circuit by:
- Adding a switch to create an RC charging/discharging demo
- Including a diode to explore rectification
- Changing source type to study AC behavior
